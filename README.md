Python Keylogger with Clipboard Monitoring

This project implements a simple Python-based keylogger using the pynput library to capture and log keystrokes in real-time. It records both standard keystrokes and clipboard content (when pasted via Ctrl+V), storing them in a log file (keylogs.txt). The program is designed to run continuously, with an option to stop by pressing the Esc key. While the current version includes placeholders for Windows-specific functionality, it is easily adaptable for cross-platform use.

Features:

Logs every keypress and clipboard content (Ctrl+V).
Runs in the background and stops on Esc key press.
Simple to modify for cross-platform compatibility.

Note: This tool should be used responsibly and only in environments where it is legally permissible to monitor keystrokes.
